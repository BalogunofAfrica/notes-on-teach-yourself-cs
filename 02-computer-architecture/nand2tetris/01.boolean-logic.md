# Boolean logic

We can describe boolen by either using a boolean function e.g:

```shell
f(x, y, z) = x AND (y OR (NOT z))
```

Since with booleans we know all the possible values that x, y and z can take (i.e 0 and 1) we can create a table to visualize this

This table is called a TRUTH TABLE

The cummutative, associative, distributive laws of combinations/mathematics also apply, unlike arithmetic the distributive laws apply to both OR and AND

For NOT, the De morgan law applies

NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)

All these laws can be proved using the truth table

Then we have the idempotence law which means

NOT(x) AND NOT(x) = NOT(x)

Then we have the negation law
NOT(NOT(x)) = x

Any boolean function can be represented using an expression containing AND, OR and NOT, in fact we only need NOT and AND, because we can represent OR wrt NOT and AND

(x OR y) = NOT(NOT(x) AND NOT(y))

We can further simplify this by using just NAND which is just

NAND(x, y) = NOT(x AND y)
NAND(x, x) = NOT(x)
i.e NOT(x) = NAND(x,x)
x AND y = NOT(NAND(x, y))
**\_ = NAND((NAND(x, y)), (NAND(x, y)))
(x OR y) = NOT(NOT(x) AND NOT(y))
** = NOT(NAND(x, x) AND NAND(y, y))
\_\_ = NAND(NAND(x,x), NAND(y, y))

With just NAND, we have been able to express every other boolean function
