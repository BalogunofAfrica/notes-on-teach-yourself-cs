# Programming

Following the materials as seen in this MIT Course:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/

The course uses some form of `lisp/pseudo lisp`, I am also using a lisp dialect ([clojure](https://clojure.org/)) to follow along.
